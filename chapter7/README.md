### Calculating Costs by Instance Type

This query calculates the total cost of active EC2 instances grouped by instance type. It helps you identify which instance types incur the highest costs, allowing you to evaluate whether rightsizing or switching to a different pricing model could reduce expenses.


#### Listing 7.1 Query to calculate cost by EC2 instance type


```
SELECT 
    product_instance_type AS instance_type, 
    SUM(line_item_unblended_cost) AS total_cost 
FROM 
    cur_db.data 
WHERE 
    line_item_product_code = 'AmazonEC2'
    AND
    line_item_line_item_type = 'Usage'
GROUP BY 
    product_instance_type;
```


The query filters the CUR dataset for EC2 usage (*line_item_product_code = 'AmazonEC2'*), groups the data by instance type (*product_instance_type*), and calculates the unblended cost (raw cost without discounts).


### Analyzing Costs by Purchase Option

This query breaks down costs by EC2 purchase options (On-Demand, Spot, Savings Plan, Reserved Instances) and shows how much each type contributes to overall spend. This breakdown helps identify where cost savings opportunities lieâ€”for example, underutilized Reserved Instances or excess Spot usage.


#### Listing 7.2 Query to calculate cost by EC2 purchase options


```
SELECT 
  bill_billing_period_start_date,
  line_item_usage_start_date, 
  bill_payer_account_id,

### Identifying Underutilized Reserved Instances

This query pulls all active Reserved Instance ARNs for Amazon EC2 and produces their utilization for last month. This will give you a very granular look at which Reserved Instance purchases were not being utilized to their full extent last month.

### Analyzing AWS Lambda Costs

AWS Lambda incurs costs based on factors like requests, execution time, and data transfer. This query breaks down Lambda costs by usage type, resource ID (Function ARN), and pricing plan, providing a granular view of where expenses originate.

The query calculates both unblended and amortized costs, providing a clear view of where Lambda expenses are concentrated. This helps identify areas for optimization, such as reducing execution time or minimizing unnecessary data transfer.

### Graviton-Based Instance Utilization

AWS Graviton instances offer better price-performance ratios, making them a preferred option for many workloads (they delivery up to 40% improvement over comparable current gen x86 processors). Graviton-based EC2 instances are available, and many other AWS services such as Amazon Relational Database Service, Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon EMR, and Amazon OpenSearch also support Graviton-based instance types.

This query provides insights into the usage and cost of Graviton-based instances for the last 6 months. Output is grouped by day, payer account ID, linked account ID, service, instance type, and region.


#### Listing 7.5 Query calculating cost and usage of Graviton based EC2 instances

### Spot Instance Cost Savings

Spot Instances offer significant cost savings, but tracking these savings requires comparing Spot prices to On-Demand prices. This query calculates average savings (over the past three months) for Spot Instances compared to the On-Demand public pricing for EC2 instances.


#### Listing 7.6 Query calculating monthly savings of Spot instances usage compared to On-demand instances


```

  -- SUM(line_item_unblended_cost) as "Spot Cost",  -- uncomment to reveal spot costs
  -- SUM(pricing_public_on_demand_cost) as "On-Demand", -- uncomment to reveal OD costs
  CAST(ROUND((AVG(1 - (line_item_unblended_cost / pricing_public_on_demand_cost)) * 100),2) as VARCHAR) || '%' as "avg_percentage_savings"
FROM 
  cur_db.data
WHERE 
  line_item_usage_type LIKE '%SpotUsage%'
  AND line_item_product_code = 'AmazonEC2'
  AND line_item_line_item_type = 'Usage'
  AND (CAST(CONCAT(billing_period, '-01') AS date) >= (DATE_TRUNC('month', current_date) - INTERVAL '1' MONTH)) -- lookback period
  -- AND product_instance_type = 'm7g.2xlarge' -- uncomment for specific instance type
GROUP BY 
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5
ORDER BY 
  product_instance_type,
  product['availability_zone']
```


This is a small subset of helpful queries you can perform to identify cost-saving opportunities and understand your cloud costs and usage. For a complete list of SQL queries, check the GitHub repository associated with the book, where you can find advanced queries to identify and optimize your AWS, GCP, and Azure compute resources.

While running SQL queries may be suitable for technical users, non-technical stakeholders involved in the FinOps process often require visual representations and interactive dashboards to gain insights effectively. Thatâ€™s why you can leverage techniques covered in previous chapters to use FinOps dashboards built with QuickSight or take advantage of the out-of-the-box dashboards provided by the CUDOS Framework.
